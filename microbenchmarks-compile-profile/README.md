# README Microbenchmarks

IBM PISA examples have been further extended, with a specific configuration for microbenchmarks (https://github.com/andrea-gi/microbench).

LLVM bitcode ```<benchmark_name>.bc``` must be placed in the ```compile/<benchmark_name>/``` folder, as source for PISA instrumentation.
