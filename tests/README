Use the regression test in this directory before committing major modifications.

First install our software and check that the following folders can be found:
    $PISA_ROOT/ibm-pisa/example-compile-run/compile/app0
    $PISA_ROOT/ibm-pisa/example-compile-run/profile/app0
    $PISA_ROOT/ibm-pisa/example-compile-run/references .

From this directory, run '$> ./regressionTestApp0.sh'.

It recompiles the application in example-compile-run/compile/app0 for the coupled and decoupled implementations. If the decoupled implementation fails, run the regression test only for the coupled version. Then it profiles the application execution and compares the current output with the reference one using diff. If the diff output is not empty, it is printed together with warning messages. Check these warnings.They might be fine though, e.g. the instruction count might vary with the LLVM version. But all fields must be there. If everything is fine you should get a similar output at the end of the test (note that in this example noise is perturbating the coupled analysis):

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS IN CNLS ANALYSIS:
1233c1233 < 194 --- > 192 1245c1245 < 1 --- > 2 1253c1253 < 0.9651 --- > 0.9552 1257c1257 < 0.9701 --- > 0.9601 1261c1261 < 0.9751 --- > 0.9651 1265c1265 < 0.98 --- > 0.9751
PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK /home/mariani/workspace/compilers/llvm-3.5/example-compile-profile/profile/app0/differences.cnls
Or use a GUI to compare: /home/mariani/workspace/compilers/llvm-3.5/example-compile-profile/profile/app0/output.cnls /home/mariani/workspace/compilers/llvm-3.5/example-compile-profile/references/app0.cnls 

NOTE: 
The script regressionTestApp0.sh does not recompile the libraries (or the pass) of our software. Before running the test you need to have installed the version of our software (coupled or decoupled) you want to test.

If you extended our software with additional fields in the JSON output, you will get warning messages. If you are sure that the output is correct, run '$> generateReferences.sh'.
