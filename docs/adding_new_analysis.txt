* How to add a new analysis *
*****************************

libanalysisCoupled.cc (for the coupled version of the software) is the main 
file of the library. This file includes all the exposed library calls.

The analysis are abstracted in the WKLDchar class. This class contains a
member of each type of analysis (InstructionMix, DataTempReuse, InstTempReuse,
RegisterCount, LoadStoreVerbose, MPIstats, ILP, etc.). Adding a new analysis
will imply to also add a member of that type in the header file of the 
WKLDchar class.

The new member must be initialized in the WKLDchar constructor class.

'analyze' function (from WKLDchar) calls all the 'visit' functions, from each 
active analysis.

'dump' function (from WKLDchar) calls all the 'dump' functions, from each 
active analysis.

Typically all the analysis extend the InstructionAnalysis class, but this is
not mandatory. The extended class includes the corresponding thread_id and
processor_id and an API to get the instruction type and memory access size
(if any).

If a new analysis is added, modify the Makefile to also compile the new class file.
